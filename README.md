# Academic-Scheduling
By this project, the general class scheduling and exam scheduling problem for the schools around the globe is solved. The data and problem of St. Paul’s school, London (ON) is taken for this project. It can be directly used by St. Paul’s school that will save much time and efforts. Initially, around 7 research papers related to this problem were studied. The review of which is included in this report. In most of the cases, the problem was solved as an assignment problem using Hungarian algorithm. But later, it came out that Shortest Augmenting Path algorithm by Martello and Toth was more efficient for solving the assignment problem. Whereas in this project, the problem is solved using genetic algorithm in python. The basic aim of this project is to minimize the conflicts between the schedules of classes or exams to 0. Genetic algorithm basically creates number of generations and verifies if the conflicts are removed or not. If conflicts exist in the given generation, it creates another generation removing those conflicts and the process continues so on until the conflicts reduces to 0. The idea of this algorithm is derived from the Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution. As, in the theory of natural evolution, the fittest individual is selected for reproduction and the offspring produced from that individual will be more fitter and have better chance of survival.
